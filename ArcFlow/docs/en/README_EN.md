## 💡 Motivation

I didn't want another todo-app portfolio. Instead, I asked myself: *How would I build a real-world feature with persistence, async workflows, and external API integration cleanly in Blazor?*

DevToolbox is my answer — a project where I make deliberate architectural decisions, document them, and demonstrate them through concrete features. The focus is not on feature quantity, but on **depth and quality** of implementation.

## 🔭 Scope of this Project

DevToolbox is a **portfolio showcase**, not a production tool. The project grows organically — new features are only added when they are architecturally interesting and bring real complexity.

### 🎵 YouTube Playlist Manager (Architecture Demonstrator)

The main feature deliberately combines several challenges in one:

- **Playlist Management** — Create and organize custom playlists
- **Integrated Player** — YouTube IFrame API via controlled JS interop
- **Drag & Drop** — SortableJS with deliberate lifecycle handling in Blazor
- **Persistence** — Local storage via SQLite (EF Core)
- **Explicit State Management** — Store-driven data flow through Actions, Reducers, and Effects

> More tools will follow when they bring something architecturally new to the table.

## 🧠 Architecture — TL;DR

The project uses a **strict store architecture** with unidirectional data flow:

```
UI → Action → Reducer → State → UI
                ↓
            Effects (DB, JS Interop)
```

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | All feature state lives in the store |
| **Pure Reducers** | No DB access, no JS, no async logic |
| **Side-Effect Isolation** | DB and JS interop exclusively in Effects |
| **UI is dispatch-only** | Components read state and dispatch actions — no direct manipulation |

This architecture is deliberately stricter than necessary for a project of this size. The goal is to demonstrate that I don't just know these principles — I apply them consistently.

## 🎯 Why this matters

This project shows how I approach software development:

- **Make architectural decisions deliberately** instead of copy-pasting from tutorials
- **Take state management seriously** — even when Blazor doesn't "need" Redux
- **Use JS interop in a controlled way** — no hidden state between C# and JavaScript
- **Document code** — not just what, but why

> In short: The feature isn't the showcase — the way it's built is.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

> No deadlines, no promises — just the direction this project is heading.

**Current Focus**
- Stabilize and harden the store architecture
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)

**Next**
- Error handling strategy — unified pattern for store errors and UI feedback
- Undo/redo for queue actions — demonstrates time-travel capability of the store architecture
- Shuffle/repeat modes — extend existing queue logic with playback strategies
- Polish UI — responsiveness, edge cases, micro-interactions

**On the Radar**
- Playback persistence — restore player state (position, active track) across sessions
- Cross-feature communication — event bus or shared state between future feature modules
